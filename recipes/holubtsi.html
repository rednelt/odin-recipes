    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Holubtsi are one of the most popular Ukrainian meat-based dishes, typically consumed on festive occasions or
        weekends. They are cabbage rolls stuffed with the mixture of cooked rice and minced meat (pork or beef).
        However, the vegetarian option – with rice or buckwheat only – is the traditional choice on Christmas Eve and
        during the Great Lent. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (4,5 lb) head white cabbage</li>
        <li>1 lb pork </li>
        <li>½ lb chicken </li>
        <li>½ lb beef </li>
        <li>4 onions</li>
        <li>1 (4 oz) cup rice</li>
        <li>½ lb tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 small carrots</li>
        <li>8 oz sour cream</li>
        <li>4 oz tomato paste</li>
        <li>1-2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate the cabbage leaves from the cob and scald the leaves in boiling salted water for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>If the leaves are large, cut along the vein on both sides. Otherwise, just cut off the veins, but be careful
            not to cut through the leaf.</li>
        <li>Set aside any damaged or small leaves. Line the pot bottom with the scalded cabbage leaves. If you have
            enough, place them around the sides as well.</li>
        <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water and boil it until semi-ready (approx. 7-10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Mix the ground meat and rice together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Fry the onions until translucent. Set aside 1⁄2 for the sauce and use 1⁄2 for the filling.</li>
        <li>Grate and sauté the carrots with approximately 3 tbsp oil and 1 tbsp butter over a medium-to-high heat until
            soft. These are added to the filling for their flavor.</li>
        <li>Mix the fried onions, carrots, and tomato paste together.</li>
        <li>Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>For small leaves: slice off the raised surface of the tough center stem just to flatten the leaf and make it
            easier to roll. </li>
        <li>Fill each leaf with about 2 tbsp meat mixture. </li>
        <li>Place the filling over the stem/bottom portion. Roll like a burrito and tug both ends in with your fingers.
        </li>
        <li>For large leaves: cut the leaves in half down the center, removing the tough stem. You will end up with 2
            leaves.</li>
        <li>Place 2 tbsp meat mixture at the top of each (or as much as you can fit).</li>
        <li>Roll the leaf into a cone shape with the thicker part of the leaf at the base and stuff the wide part into
            the top.</li>
        <li>As you stuff your cabbage, arrange the rolls in the same pot you used to cook the cabbage.</li>
        <li>Place the cabbage rolls into the pot, wedging together tightly.</li>
        <li>Depending on the size and shape of the pot and the number of cabbage rolls, you may need to layer them.</li>
        <li>Mix the remaining carrots with the sliced tomatoes and cream.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over them. The sauce should percolate through and completely cover the cabbage rolls. If it
            doesn’t, add a bit of water or tomato juice to make the sauce thinner.</li>
        <li>Cover the arranged rolls with the remaining cabbage leaves.</li>
        <li>Bake for 2-3 hours at 350 °F. Check on the level of the sauce from time to time. If it is getting low, add a
            bit of water to keep the edges of the holubtsi from burning.</li>
        <li>When cooked, let sit for 15 minutes. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and dill or parsley.</li>
    </ol>
